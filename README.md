# 🎯 Project: Netflix Movies and Shows

<hr>

In this project, you will be working with a dataset containing listings of movies and TV shows available on Netflix up until 2021. The goal of this project is to perform `data cleaning` tasks and create `visualizations` to gain insights into the Netflix content library.

## 🎯 Netflix Movies and Shows
The Netflix dataset contains comprehensive information about movies and TV shows available on the Netflix streaming platform up until 2021. It provides a listing of the vast collection of content available for viewers worldwide. The dataset includes details such as the title, genre, release year, duration, country of origin, and cast/crew information for each movie or TV show.

## 🎯 TODOs...

<br>

**1. Data Cleaning**:

- Create a **notebook** with the name `netflix-project.ipynb` where you'll do all your work
- Load and explore the data to have an understanding of what it represent.
- Remove any duplicate entries in the dataset.
- Handle missing values by either imputing or removing them.
- Standardize and clean up the text data, such as titles or genres, to ensure consistency.
    
**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

- Perform descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of release years, genres, and durations.
- Explore the relationship between release years and the number of movies/TV shows available.

**3. Data Visualization**:

- Visualize the _TOP 10 countries_ contributing to the Netflix content library using a bar plot or a world map.
- Create a `word cloud` of the most common words in movie titles or genres to identify popular themes or trends.
- Create visualizations to _analyze the distribution_ of content across different genres.
- Design an _interactive dashboard_ to explore the dataset, allowing users to filter by genre, release year, or country.

## 🎯 HINTs...
- Before starting, make sure to make a `copy` of the original dataset to preserve the integrity of the data.
- Utilize pandas functions and methods, such as `drop_duplicates()`, `fillna()`, and `str.replace()`as discussed in the lessons, to handle cleaning tasks.
- Use `Seaborn` and/or `matplotlib` libraries for visualizations. Experiment with different types of plots and charts, such as bar plots, pie charts, and word clouds.
- Focus on visualizing aspects such as the distribution of genres, the trend in release years, or the duration of movies and TV shows.
- Consider interactive visualizations such as _dashboards_, to enable users to explore the dataset and interact with the data.
- Document your data cleaning process and provide clear explanations and interpretations for each visualization.


## `Good Luck! 🤝`
